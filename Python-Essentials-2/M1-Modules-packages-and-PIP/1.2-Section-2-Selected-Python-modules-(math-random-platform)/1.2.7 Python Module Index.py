# 1.2.7 Python Module Index

# We have only covered the basics of Python modules here. 
# Python's modules make up their own universe, in which Python itself is only a galaxy, 
# and we would venture to say that exploring the depths of these modules can take significantly more time than getting acquainted with "pure" Python.

# Moreover, the Python community all over the world creates and maintains hundreds of additional modules used in very niche applications like genetics, psychology, 
# or even astrology.

# These modules aren't (and won't be) distributed along with Python, or through official channels, which makes the Python universe broader - almost infinite.

# You can read about all standard Python modules here: https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html.


# Don't worry - you won't need all these modules. Many of them are very specific.

# All you need to do is find the modules you want, and teach yourself how to use them. It's easy.

# In the next section we'll take a look at something else. We're going to show you how to write your own module.
